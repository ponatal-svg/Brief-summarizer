## The Hook
As AI agents are increasingly deployed autonomously at scale, a critical challenge has emerged: ensuring they optimize for true organizational purpose rather than just measurable but misaligned objectives. This content argues that "intent engineering" is the crucial next discipline required to bridge this gap, as evidenced by major enterprise deployments facing mixed results despite massive investment.

## Key Findings
*   The CLA AI agent handled 2.3 million conversations, reducing resolution times from 11 minutes to two, and initially projected $40 million in savings, with reported actual savings of $60 million. However, the CEO admitted it cost "something far more valuable than $60 million" due to lower quality, demonstrating that the AI, though "extraordinarily good at resolving tickets fast," optimized for the "wrong goal." [t=93s]
*   Prompt engineering is described as individual and synchronous, while context engineering, which Anthropic defined in September 2025 as crafting the entire information state, is where the industry is currently focused. However, "intent engineering" is introduced as the "third discipline" that instructs agents "what to want" by encoding organizational purpose as "structured, actionable parameters" into infrastructure. [t=373s]
*   Despite significant AI investment, with 57% of respondents allocating between 21% and 50% of digital transformation budgets to AI automation, and 20% investing over half (an average of $700 million for companies with $13 billion in revenue), Deloitte's 2026 report found 84% of companies "have not redesigned jobs around AI" and only 21% possess a "mature model for agent governance." Consequently, 74% of companies report "yet to see tangible value from AI." [t=470s]
*   Microsoft Copilot, despite billions in investment and adoption by 85% of Fortune 500 companies, saw only 5% move from pilot to larger deployment, with approximately 3% of Microsoft 365 users adopting it as paid users. This suggests a failure of "organizational intent alignment" rather than solely UX or model quality issues, according to the presenter. [t=594s]
*   The "intent gap" exists across three layers: first, a unified context infrastructure, which is still unbuilt with teams creating "shadow agents" and individual context stacks, despite the Model Context Protocol (MCP) becoming "the de facto standard" with "close to 100 million" monthly SDK downloads; second, a coherent AI worker toolkit, where individual AI workflows hinder organizational leverage; and third, "intent engineering proper," which demands "machine readable expressions of organizational intent" for agents, encompassing goal structures, "delegation frameworks," and feedback mechanisms. [t=1090s]

## The So What?
The presenter concludes that the AI race is no longer an "intelligence race" focused on models like Opus 4.6, Gemini 3, or GPT 5.2, but an "intent race." Organizations must prioritize "organizational intent architecture," making goals, values, and decision frameworks agent-actionable. This "management innovation" is crucial for aligning agents to objectives at scale, similar to how OKRs aligned humans, and is needed urgently to prevent AI agents from causing "active harm to the business" by optimizing for misaligned goals.
