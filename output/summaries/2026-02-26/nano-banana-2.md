## The Hook
Nano Banana 2 has launched, identified as the Gemini 3.1 flash image, offering a "smaller, faster, cheaper" alternative with "almost as good quality" as the Nano Banana Pro model. This release presents a new option for image generation workflows, particularly for those for whom the Pro version was cost-prohibitive.

## Key Findings
*   Nano Banana 2 is the Gemini 3.1 flash image, positioned as a quality improvement over the Gemini 2.5 flash image and often "very close to equal" to the Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro image). [t=0s]
*   The model is "extremely good at text," excelling in precise instruction following, text rendering, and translation, correctly handling text in various prompts and languages like Italian and Thai. [t=94s]
*   It features full aspect ratio support, resolution down to 512 pixels, and two thinking levels. It also includes an "image search" tool that the Nano Banana Pro does not have, in addition to the Google search tool. [t=251s]
*   Nano Banana 2 shows "a lot better character consistency" and supports up to "14 different reference pictures" for generation, a "big win" for product-related applications. [t=281s]
*   The model is "not as expensive as Nano Banana Pro," making it a "win" for those considering the Nano Banana Pro in production but finding it "too expensive" for scale. It will be rolled out across Google apps and Google Cloud. [t=343s]

## The So What?
This release is a significant development for users seeking cost-effective yet high-quality image generation, especially for production needs where the Nano Banana Pro's expense was a barrier. The presenter encourages users to experiment with the model and share their findings regarding its strengths and usability compared to the Nano Banana Pro.
