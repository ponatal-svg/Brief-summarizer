## The Hook
Google has released Gemini 3.1 Pro, marking the first time a 0.1 version has been introduced in the Gemini series and arriving nearly 100 days after the initial Gemini 3 release. This update is significant as it incorporates lessons from the Gemini Deep Think models, potentially redefining the competitive landscape for large language models.

## Key Findings
*   According to the presenter, Gemini 3.1 Pro demonstrates a "huge bump" in performance over Gemini 3 Pro on benchmarks such as the Humanities last exam and Arc AGI, where it achieved 77% compared to Gemini 3 Pro's 31%. [[t=157s]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXexi2LoCfI&t=157)
*   The model introduces new thinking levels (low, medium, or high), with the presenter stating that setting thinking to high "acts almost like a mini version of Gemini deep think," a capability they note the developers have emphasized. [[t=378s]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXexi2LoCfI&t=378)
*   On an International Math Olympiad problem, Gemini 3.1 Pro, with thinking set to high, provided a correct answer in "over 8 minutes," approximately half the "17 plus minutes" that Deep Think previously took. [[t=346s]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXexi2LoCfI&t=346)
*   The presenter observed that while setting thinking to low resulted in "much faster" processing, it "didn't get the correct answer," leading them to emphasize the importance of adjusting the thinking level for different tasks. [[t=410s]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXexi2LoCfI&t=410)
*   The presenter notes that Gemini 3.1 Pro generates better designs and graphics, which they claim implies the use of "really good RL environments for training these kinds of tasks." [[t=220s]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXexi2LoCfI&t=220)

## The So What?
The release of Gemini 3.1 Pro, despite being a 0.1 increment, is presented as a "big update" that re-establishes the model's competitive standing against Opus 4.6 six and the latest GPT models. The presenter suggests that this performance bump may spur other model developers to release new versions in response.
