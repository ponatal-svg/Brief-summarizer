## The Hook
Despite significant investment and widespread perception of AI as a job market disruptor, a new study reveals that AI performs worse than humans in the vast majority of real-world professional tasks. This challenges the current valuation and expectations of AI's near-term capabilities.

## Key Findings
*   According to a new study, when compared to a human, AI performs worse a "whopping 96.25% of the time" in real generalized work, meaning it performs at least nine out of ten tasks worse. [t=31s]
*   The study used a "remote labor index or RLI" method, giving AI models 240 real jobs from the freelancer site Upwork, each paying "$630 on average," across various fields like video creation, graphic design, and architecture. [t=123s]
*   The performance of AI models was described as "abysmal"; the "best AI was Claude Opus 4.5 with a 3.75% success rate," representing a 96.25% failure rate, while Gemini performed worse with a "1.25% success rate." [t=155s]
*   AI systems primarily failed by producing "corrupt or empty files," submitting "incomplete work," exhibiting poor quality that "does not meet professional standards," and showing inconsistencies in generated work. [t=216s], [t=247s]
*   AI did succeed in certain areas, including "creative ideas like audio and image related work," writing, data retrieval/web scraping, advertisement and logo creation, report writing, and generating simple code for interactive data visualization. [t=279s]
*   The presenter notes that Microsoft "proudly proclaimed that 30% of their code was written by AI" 9 months ago, which was followed by "some of the worst software issues at the company in its history." [t=439s]
*   In early 2026, the presenter cites a Reuters report that the FDA received "100 reports of AI malfunctions" in the medical field, including botched surgeries, misidentified body parts, and allegations of AI misinforming surgeons, leading to patient harm. [t=563s]
*   Yan Lee Kun, the creator of convolutional neural networks, states that the current AI architecture is reaching its peak and believes that throwing more data and power at the problem will not solve it, comparing current claims of human-level intelligence to similar, incorrect declarations by AI scientists since the 1950s. [t=689s]

## The So What?
This study strongly suggests that current AI technology, particularly large language models, serves as a time-saving tool for specific tasks rather than a broad human replacement. The presenter advises caution regarding the "significant financial risk" in the current AI space due to potential overvaluation and misallocation of "hundreds of billions of dollars," emphasizing the ongoing need for human oversight and skilled implementation rather than uncritical adoption.
