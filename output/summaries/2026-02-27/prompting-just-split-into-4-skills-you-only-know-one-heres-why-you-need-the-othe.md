## The Hook
Prompting has evolved beyond simple chat interfaces; with autonomous agents now running for days or weeks against specifications, the old "chat-based" prompting skills from 2025 are functionally obsolete for serious work. This content reveals that "prompting" has diverged into four distinct, cumulative skill sets, and a significant performance gap is already emerging between those who understand all four and those who only practice one.

## Key Findings
*   Autonomous agent capabilities in models like Opus 4.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro, and GPT 5.3 codecs, released in early 2026, mean models act as long-running workers (for days or weeks) rather than chat partners, requiring all context and course corrections to be encoded upfront. [t=125s]
*   The presenter highlights a "10x gap" in productivity observed in February 2026: a person using 2025 skills gets an 80% correct PowerPoint deck with 40 minutes of cleanup, while a person using 2026 skills writes a structured specification in 11 minutes and completes five other decks before lunch using the same model. [t=343s]
*   Prompting has diverged into four distinct, cumulative disciplines: 1) **Prompt Craft** (the original, synchronous, now table stakes skill), 2) **Context Engineering** (curating the optimal set of tokens, often making up 99.98% of the information an LLM sees beyond the initial prompt), 3) **Intent Engineering** (encoding organizational purpose, goals, and values, as illustrated by the Claro story where an agent optimized for resolution times but not customer satisfaction), and 4) **Specification Engineering** (writing agent-executable documents across an organization, viewing the entire informational corpus as agent-readable). [t=562s]
*   Specification engineering, the highest-level skill, is built upon five "primitives" that must be learned: self-contained problem statements, acceptance criteria (describing what "done" looks like), constraint architecture (musts, must-nots, preferences, escalation triggers), decomposition (breaking large tasks into independently executable components, ideally under 2 hours), and evaluation design (measurably proving output quality with test cases). [t=1649s]
*   Companies like Telus, reporting 13,000 custom AI solutions internally, and Zapia, with over 800 agents internally, are already deploying agents at scale, indicating that this operational shift is a current reality. [t=217s]

## The So What?
According to the presenter, mastering these four progressive prompting disciplines is critical for individuals and organizations to harness AI effectively in 2026 and beyond. This shift not only improves AI output quality but also enforces a new level of communication discipline in human-to-human interactions, ultimately leading to clearer thinking and more aligned organizational performance.
