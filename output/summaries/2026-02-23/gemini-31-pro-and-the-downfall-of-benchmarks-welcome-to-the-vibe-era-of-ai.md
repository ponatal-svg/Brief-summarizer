## The Hook
The release of Gemini 3.1 Pro has underscored a critical challenge in evaluating AI models: headline benchmark scores frequently contradict real-world performance, largely due to models' increasing specialization and the inherent difficulties in measuring true general intelligence. This content delves into why traditional benchmarks are proving inadequate and how AI labs are navigating this complex landscape.

## Key Findings
*   The post-training stage now accounts for 80% of LLM compute, focusing on honing models for specific domains, which means models excelling in one area are less likely to be generally superior. For instance, on an Epoch AI chess puzzle benchmark, Claude Sonnet 4.5 scored 12% five months ago, while Claude Opus 4.6 scored just 10% last week. [t=155s]
*   Benchmarks are susceptible to models finding "unintended arithmetic patterns" or taking shortcuts. In ARC AGI 2, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored 77.1% against Claude Opus 4.6's 69%, but a researcher noted that changing input encoding reduced accuracy. On a private "Simple Bench" common sense test, Gemini 3.1 Pro achieved 79.6%, yet open-ended questions caused a 15 to 20 percentage point drop in scores. [t=463s]
*   Hallucinations remain an unresolved issue, despite not always being directly measured in model release charts. An "Omniscience" benchmark showed Gemini 3.1 Pro with a top factual accuracy score of +30, compared to Claude Opus 4.6 at +11. However, when examining incorrect answers, 50% from Gemini 3.1 Pro were hallucinations, versus 38% for Claude Sonnet 4.6 and 34% for GLM 5. [t=558s]
*   According to Dario Amade, CEO of Anthropic, their bet is that "if you specialize in enough specialisms, you'll generalize to all specialisms," suggesting that AGI might be achieved primarily through extensive data specialization rather than continuous learning, potentially relying on very long context windows, such as Claude 4.6's ability to absorb 750,000 words. [t=775s]
*   The predictive performance of models on Metaculus is rising significantly, almost reaching the level of an average human forecaster. However, concerns arise about "open claw agents" potentially gaming predictive markets. Additionally, new benchmarks are emerging, focusing on speed, with some models showing "unbelievable tokens per second," and realism in video generation, exemplified by Seed Dance 2.0 from ByteDance as a notable "step up." [t=1084s]

## The So What?
The current AI landscape signifies a shift from a clear "generalist era" to a "vibe era" where evaluating models demands a nuanced understanding of their specialized capabilities and inherent limitations. Users and developers should approach benchmark results with skepticism, acknowledging models' propensity for shortcuts and the persistence of issues like hallucinations, rather than solely relying on publicized scores.
