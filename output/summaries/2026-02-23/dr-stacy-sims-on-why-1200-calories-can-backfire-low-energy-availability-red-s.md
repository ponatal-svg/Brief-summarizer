## The Hook
Many individuals, especially type A women and teenagers, suffer from relative energy deficiency in sports (RED-S) and low energy availability due to restrictive eating, hindering health and performance, challenging the "eat less to become smaller" belief.

## Key Findings
*   Low energy availability (LEA) occurs when the body lacks sufficient calories (around 1,200 to 1,400 calories for basic existence) and activity, causing "unessential mechanisms" to downregulate. This manifests as "brain foggy" fatigue, slower reaction time, and sleep disruption. [t=125s]
*   RED-S impacts all body systems, causing psychological issues (anxiety, depression, severe PMS) and a critical decrease in bone density, particularly in puberty where brain neuroplasticity can be muted. [t=218s]
*   According to Dr. Stacy Sims, the easiest fix for chronic fatigue and lack of training response in low energy states is to eat more. This paradoxically leads to weight loss, improved body composition, and new PRs and PBS. [t=374s]

## The So What?
Adequate caloric intake is paramount for health, performance, and body composition, challenging restrictive "calories in calories out" mindsets.
