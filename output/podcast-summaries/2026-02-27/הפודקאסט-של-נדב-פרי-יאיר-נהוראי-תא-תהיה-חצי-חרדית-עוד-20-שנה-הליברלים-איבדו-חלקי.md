## The Zionist Project and its Illiberal Trajectory

In this episode of Nadav Peri's podcast, Yair Nehorai discusses the profound and, according to him, irreversible shift in the character of Israeli society, driven by a specific branch of religious Zionism rooted in Rabbi Kook's philosophy. Nehorai argues that the liberal camp fails to grasp the depth of this transformation, leading to a binary future: either a religious Halachic state or a fractured society of separate "cantons."

### Key Findings

*   **Religious Zionism's Dual Origins**: According to Nehorai, early religious Zionism, spearheaded by Rabbi Reines, saw secular Zionism as a "safe haven" and not inherently redemptive. However, Rabbi Kook later introduced the idea of secular Zionism as a "divine act" initiating a "redemptive process" towards a Halachic state. This latter, more messianic, interpretation, which Nehorai terms "Rav Kook's Hasidism," now dominates religious Zionist institutions.
*   **The "Elkanah Method" and Deep State Takeover**: Nehorai explains that leaders like Eli Sadan and Yigal Levinstein (founders of the Bnei David pre-military academy) employ a strategy—the "Elkanah method"—to infiltrate and transform democratic institutions from within. This has led to an effective takeover of the military rabbinate and a significant presence of "messianic rabbis" in key positions across the military and judiciary. Nehorai believes this constitutes a "deep state" operating within Israel's institutions.
*   **A Divided Future**: Nehorai projects a future within 20-30 years where major Israeli cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem will be at least "half-Haredi" due to this expansionist strategy. He describes a process where Haredim establish a presence in secular areas, gradually asserting a "democracy" where their majority dictates the terms of public life, leading secular residents to leave.
*   **The Struggle is Religious, Not Compromising**: Nehorai argues that the current conflict is a fundamental "religious struggle," not a matter of political compromise. He dismisses the liberal camp's attempts to negotiate or "coexist," asserting that Rav Kook's Hasidism's ultimate goal is a Halachic state, where Torah law governs. Any liberal values like human rights or freedom of religion are seen as opposing this redemptive goal.
*   **Call for Liberal "Cantons"**: Given this perceived inevitable trajectory, Nehorai advocates for the liberal camp to embrace its own sectoral identity, similar to how Haredim operate. He suggests establishing separate liberal cities, educational systems, and even military units (cantons) where secular and pluralistic values are maintained, free from religious coercion. This is presented as the only way for the liberal way of life to survive.

### The So What?

Nehorai's stark portrayal of Israel's future, as a society on an unstoppable path toward religious governance and fragmentation, demands a critical examination from listeners. His call for the liberal camp to adopt a similar "canton" strategy underscores a deep skepticism about the viability of shared civil spaces in the long run. This perspective challenges conventional notions of Israeli unity and highlights the urgent need for a realistic assessment of the forces shaping the nation's identity and future.
