## The "War of Consciousness": Confronting the Core Ideology of the Palestinian Conflict

This episode delves into the deep-seated ideological conflict shaping the Israeli-Palestinian narrative, arguing that ignoring the underlying Palestinian "war of consciousness" led directly to failures in peace processes and security, notably culminating in the events of October 7th.

*   Einat Wilf, former MK and co-author of "The War of Return," asserts that the Palestinian refusal of statehood offers (including those from Camp David 2000, Taba, and Olmert in 2008) stems from a core ideology, "Palestinianism," which prioritizes the non-existence of a Jewish sovereign state in historic Palestine, rather than the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. This is evidenced by their consistent rejection of proposals offering significant land and sovereignty.
*   According to Wilf, the demand for a "right of return" for millions of refugees to within Israel's 1967 borders is not a negotiable point for the Palestinian leadership, but rather a sacred, non-negotiable goal aimed at demographically overwhelming Israel. She states that Abu Mazen himself would affirm the sacredness of this right, along with the right of refugees to return to cities like Akko and Haifa, not just a future Palestinian state.
*   Wilf highlights UNRWA (the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), the perpetuation of the "right of return" narrative, and organizations like Al Jazeera as key "generators" and "oxygen" providers for this ideology. She explains that UNRWA has registered generations of Palestinians as refugees, fostering the belief that their return to pre-1948 homes is imminent, despite being born in places like Gaza.
*   She criticizes the Israeli approach as being reactive, focused on "buying quiet" and security measures like fences, rather than addressing the ideological roots of the conflict. Wilf argues that the Israeli left was correct in saying Israel cannot ignore the Palestinians, and the right was correct in recognizing the Palestinian refusal to accept a Jewish state; however, both sides failed to deal with the underlying ideology.
*   Wilf believes that 70% of the conflict is a "war of consciousness" fought in the international arena (academia, media, global institutions), which Israel has largely neglected. She contends that prior to October 7th, Israel had "zero international legitimacy" for many of its core positions, and the world increasingly believes that removing "the evil of Zionism" (equated with colonialism and imperialism) would improve global well-being.

The episode concludes by stressing that the current conflict cannot be resolved through conventional military or diplomatic means alone if the core ideological drivers are ignored. Wilf, through her new political movement, advocates for a "radical shift" in Israel's strategy, moving from a reactive, security-centric approach to proactively dismantling the ideology of Palestinianism by exposing its rejectionist nature and building international support for a genuine two-state solution, or an alternative that acknowledges the Palestinians' true goals.
