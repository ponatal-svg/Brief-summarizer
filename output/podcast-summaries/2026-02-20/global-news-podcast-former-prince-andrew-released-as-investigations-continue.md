## The Hook
This episode of the Global News Podcast reports on the arrest and questioning of Britain's former Prince Andrew in the wake of the Epstein files, alongside a new amnesty law in Venezuela and the latest on a potential universal vaccine.

## Key Findings
*   Former Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested and questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office, specifically for allegedly sharing confidential documents with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while serving as a trade envoy. His brother, King Charles, stated the royal family would give full support and cooperation to the investigation, while Andrew himself denies wrongdoing.
*   Venezuela's interim president has signed an amnesty law expected to result in the release of hundreds of political prisoners, though it is less generous than earlier drafts. This law would not cover military officers accused of rebellion or actions referred to as "hate crimes," such as publishing anti-government messages.
*   US researchers are developing a universal vaccine in a nasal spray format that has shown the ability to protect against various viruses, including colds, flu, and COVID-19, as well as some bacterial infections and allergies, in animal trials. Human clinical trials are still needed for this vaccine, which represents a radical departure from traditional vaccine development.
*   In Iran, dozens of promising athletes were killed in last month's crackdown, with the US-based Center for Human Rights verifying 47 deaths. Athletes are reportedly under severe intimidation for supporting protests, but some are still finding ways to show their anger, such as not celebrating goals in football matches.
*   US President Trump welcomed global leaders to Washington for the launch of his "Board of Peace," pledging billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Gaza. The US has committed $10 billion, with other nations pledging $7 billion, but the UK, Canada, France, and Germany have refused to join.

## The So What?
The podcast highlights ongoing global tensions and humanitarian concerns, from royal controversies and political prisoner releases to medical breakthroughs and severe crackdowns on dissent, underscoring the complex and often contradictory nature of current world events.
