## The Hook
The US Supreme Court has delivered a significant blow to President Trump's economic agenda, ruling against his tariff policies, while international tensions escalate with Iran and a global AI summit grapples with both optimism and division.

## Key Findings
*   The US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 against President Trump’s tariff policy, stating he doesn't have the power to impose them and it’s up to Congress. This decision was seen by some as an “extraordinary day for the global economy.”
*   In the wake of Trump's threats of strikes on Iran, Norway withdrew 60 soldiers from the Middle East, and Iranian authorities warned that US military bases in the region would be "legitimate targets" in any conflict.
*   A BBC analysis revealed that over 180,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, with rural areas bearing a disproportionately heavy toll, while new draconian laws make it difficult to report dissent.
*   For the first time, DNA from a dead lion was used to prosecute poachers in Zimbabwe, leading to two arrests and hailed as a "step change" in wildlife crime investigations.
*   At a global AI summit in India, excitement over AI's potential was met with concerns about its dangers and division over regulation, with the US government vetoing calls for a UN-style oversight body.
*   The completion of the tallest tower, the Tower of Jesus, at Barcelona's Sagrada Familia church marks a major construction milestone, though the cathedral is still expected to take another 8-9 years to finish.
