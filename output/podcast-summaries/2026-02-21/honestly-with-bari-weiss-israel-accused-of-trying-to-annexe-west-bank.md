## The Future of Gaza and Social Media Accountability Under Scrutiny

This episode of the BBC Global News Podcast delves into critical international and societal issues, from the ongoing conflict in Gaza and allegations of de facto annexation in the West Bank to the legal battles facing tech giants like Meta over social media addiction.

*   A senior UN official has warned that Israel's plan to tighten control over parts of the occupied West Bank is a serious concern, describing it as "gradual de facto annexation." This comes as the UN Security Council is criticized for being "paralyzed" by the US veto power, which some argue enables Israeli "impunity."
*   Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, appeared before a jury in a landmark trial in Los Angeles, facing claims that Instagram is deliberately designed to be addictive and puts young people at risk. The case was brought by a 20-year-old woman and her mother, who allege that her obsessive use of Instagram and YouTube, starting at age six, exposed her to harmful content.
*   An Austrian man is facing charges of "killing in severe negligence" after his girlfriend died of hypothermia during a mountain climb. He is accused of making severe mistakes, including leaving her alone and turning down calls from the police, raising questions about mutual obligations in dangerous situations.
*   In Fiji, the former Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, and a former police commissioner have been arrested and charged with inciting mutiny, accused of mobilizing the military after the 2022 general election. This highlights deep political distrust and ethnic tensions following four coups since the 1980s.
*   Traditional French restaurants are closing at an alarming rate of 25 per day, with owners citing rising costs and changing consumer habits, particularly among younger generations who prefer fast food or eating at home. Simultaneously, a growing backlash against "entitled behavior" from food influencers is seeing some restaurants banning tripods and filming.

The range of topics covered—from geopolitical conflicts and their humanitarian impact to the pervasive influence of social media on mental health and the evolving landscape of global dining—underscores the complex challenges shaping societies worldwide.
