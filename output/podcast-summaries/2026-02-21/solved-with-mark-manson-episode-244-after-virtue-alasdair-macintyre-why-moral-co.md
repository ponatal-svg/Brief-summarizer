## The Hook
Alasdair MacIntyre, in "After Virtue," argues that modern moral conversations feel profoundly unsatisfying because a crucial piece of historical moral understanding—teleology—was removed during the Enlightenment, leading to a "hellscape of emotivism."

## Key Findings
*   MacIntyre suggests that historically, morality was understood through storytelling, exemplified by Homer's epics (circa 6th century BC), where virtue was tied to successfully fulfilling one's societal role (e.g., a good warrior). Plato later reacted to the complexity of these roles by positing a "universal good" from which virtues stemmed, leading to a more ordered moral framework.
*   Aristotle further developed this by introducing "teleologies," positing that entities, including human life, have inherent "ends" or "purposes" they should aim for. For Aristotle, cultivating virtues like courage or patience was a path to human flourishing, providing an objective basis for distinguishing good from bad actions.
*   The Enlightenment, with well-intentioned secular goals, sought to remove these teleologies, believing morality could be rebuilt from scratch. MacIntyre contends this project was "doomed to fail," arguing that Enlightenment thinkers either failed to provide a new foundation or "smuggled in premises" from older teleological traditions while denying their origins, creating a "simulacra of morality."
*   In the absence of a shared understanding of human purpose, moral discourse becomes "incommensurable" and unproductive, reduced to subjective emotional expressions (emotivism). This cultural shift promotes certain character types: "managers" (who prioritize value-neutral efficiency over moral purpose), "therapists" (who focus on self-management techniques rather than questioning life's ends), and "protesters" (who rely on public pressure and emotional displays rather than rational persuasion).
*   MacIntyre proposes that a solution lies in re-accessing "shared practices" that possess "internal goods" and built-in "teleologies" without resorting to ancient metaphysics. Examples like farming, chess, or medicine, when engaged in for their intrinsic value (e.g., patience in chess for better strategy, not just winning candy), develop virtues that genuinely improve participation and unlock the practice's inherent goods. These practices, in turn, are sustained by "communities" that foster a "moral tradition" by teaching virtues and correcting deviations.

## The So What?
MacIntyre offers a fundamental choice: continue in the fragmented, unsatisfying state of emotivist moral discourse (Nietzsche's path) or restore a meaningful Aristotelian framework by identifying and nurturing shared practices and the communities that uphold them. This approach allows for intelligible, productive moral conversations and a coherent pursuit of human flourishing rooted in the activities of daily life.
